<h2>The idea for the VM-1</h2>
<p>
    In the work with students at the <a href="https://hfs-berlin.de">"Ernst Busch" Academy of Dramatic Arts in Berlin</a>,
    as well as in the work with the independent theater scene, we see a constant and ever 
    growing need for accessible video technology. This mostly involves the usage of 
    pre-produced video material, often mixed with live cameras. Multiple projectors and 
    large screens are used as output media, on which the different video sources are shown.
</p>
<p>
    Software for live video (OBS-Studio, MadMapper, Isadora, TouchDesigner, vvvv, ...) 
    is often too complex for these "simple" applications, do not quite meet the needs or has a high price tag.
</p>
<p>
    Out of this need the idea for the Video Mixer "VM-1", based on a Raspberry Pi, was born at the 
    <a href="labor.hfs-berlin.de">Labor für Digitalität</a> within the "Ernst Busch" Academy of Dramatic Arts. 
    Together with software developer Nils Zweiling and an initial research funded by 
    <a href="https://stiftung-hochschullehre.de">Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre</a>, the VM-1 will be further 
    developed into a usable device.
</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>
    We checked many ressources on how to properly play back and capture video on the Raspberry Pi. The best solution seems 
    to be <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org">GStreamer</a>, which Nils compiled with the respective libraries for Raspberry Pi. The software for
    the VM-1 itself is written in Python.
